Description: Interactifier enables users to test for significant interactions between each two-order combination in a list of eligible independent variables in a linear regression against a dependent variable. This package is composed of three functions: "interactor" regresses each two-order predictor combination against the specified outcome and output each interaction coefficient p-value; "corrector" outputs each of these p-values that are significant under Bonferroni correction; "plotter" plots a 3-D graph and regression plane for two specified predictors and an outcome variable.
