Description: Interactifier enables users to test for and visualize significant interactions between each two-order combination in a list of eligible independent variables in a linear regression against a dependent variable. This package is composed of three functions: "interactor" regresses each two-order predictor combination against the specified outcome variable and outputs each interaction coefficient p-value; "corrector" takes the output from "interactor" to select each of these p-values that are significant under Bonferroni correction; "plotter" plots an interactive 3-D graph and regression plane for two specified predictors and an outcome variable.
